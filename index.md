## About Me 
Hello, my name is Dylan Plemmons. I am a student at the University of Central Florida majoring in Information Technology. My focuses are in cybersecurity and networking. I previously have worked as a network operation center technician at Presidio, which involved resolving network issues for large to small businesses.
