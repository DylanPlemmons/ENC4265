# Manual Assessment Memo

MEMORANDUM

TO: CEO of Volkswagen

FROM: Dylan Plemmons

SUBJECT: Recommendations for Volkswagen Jetta Owners Manual

DATE: February 13, 2025


This memo contains the results of an assessment of the [Volkswagen Jetta 2023 Owners Manual](https://www.manua.ls/volkswagen/jetta-2023/manual).


The owners manual for the vehicle has many strengths that make it a helpful resource to operating the car and general maintenance. One item that is useful is the inclusion of icons and coloring to direct attention for certain information. Using common icons of stop signs and warning symbols while also using the colors of red and orange to show dangers and warnings helps to highlight important information for safe usage. Another aspect of the manual that is helpful is using images and numbering to show what everything in the car displays or does. This includes showing what every button is used for and possibly linking to another part of the manual that will further explain the function that it activates/deactivates.  


While the manual is very informative and helpful on how to operate the vehicle correctly and safely, there are two key areas that could use improvements. One weak point is that it combines all the information for all trims of the model and the optional upgrades for vehicle, but does not specify which features are available on certain trims or are optional. A user may read about a function that they believe is included in the vehicle and be concerned that the function is not working. Another weakness is the text to describe a function is in a smaller font compared to the other text making it easy for a user to skim over.


To improve the manual, I recommend the following modifications:

- Specify certain functions and designs as limited to certain trims or are optional upgrades.
- Adjust the design of the text in certain areas that explain what a function does.

AI Statement: Only spellcheck was used on writing this assignment.
