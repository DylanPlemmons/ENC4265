# Chatbot
The bot I have created will provide high protein meal recipes that are easy to make for each meal of the day. I have been looking to gain weight by eating healthy and high protein meals but have struggled to find recipes that I find enjoyable or easy to make. The chatbot will ask what meal you are looking to make and ask what ingredients you would like to avoid. The tools used to create the chatbot is BoodleBox Custom Bots feature and the chatbot is powered by Claude 3.5 Sonnet. The personality of the bot is encouraging as it aims to help students achieve their weight goals with the meals it provides. It is able to communicate in a clear and friendly manner to requests and is very detailed in explaining the process to create the meal.
