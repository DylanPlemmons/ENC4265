The internet has evolved a lot over the past few years and one major aspect that has seen a big shift is the design and look of websites. Today I will be looking at some of the websites I visit regularly and examine different design details that have changed throughout the years. Iâ€™ll also look to understand if websites present today have a broad structure that is followed across multiple different websites.

One website that I visit daily to stay up to date on technology news is [theverge.com](http://theverge.com). The first and most apparent aspect that has changed is the amount of information that is presented when the site is first loaded. One capture from the launch of the news site on November 3rd, 2011, it presents multiple articles in a 3-column grid layout. It includes the headlines and authors of the story but some also include the first few sentences of the article.

Comparing the 2011 version to the present day version of the website is very different as the new design is much cleaner yet still presents the same amount of information. When first loaded the site shows the same number of articles, the headlines, authors, and date/time it was published. There is a lot more spacing between the articles and the layout is a 2-column layout.

Accessing the articles there are also some key differences between the layout of the webpages. The 2011 version has a sidebar that contains latest headlines and media and underneath the text is a gallery carousel for images. Directly below the article is the comments and replies to the article. Comparing this to the present version, there is a lot less on the screen as it focuses mainly on the text of the article. The image carousel is included inside of the article in a way that does not take up as much screen space. The comments for the article are hidden behind a button that needs to be clicked for them to expand. Directly below the article is a short list of articles that are in the same category as the original article.
